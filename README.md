# Restaurant Success Analysis
## Problem Statement
This project aims to explore how user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) impacts business success metrics (review count, ratings) in the restaurant industry using the Yelp dataset.

## Research Objectives
1. Correlation Analysis: Determine if higher user engagement correlates with more reviews and higher ratings.
2. Sentiment Impact: Investigate how positive sentiment in reviews and tips affects review count and average star rating.
3. User Engagement Trends: Examine if consistent user engagement over time indicates long-term success better than sporadic activity.

## Hypotheses
- Higher user engagement leads to more reviews and better ratings.
- Positive sentiment in reviews and tips boosts overall ratings and review counts.
- Consistent engagement over time is linked to sustained restaurant success.

## Results
Distribution of business success matrics are shown below:-

- Higher ratings does not mean there is more review, vice versa.
- Success of the restaurants may not be related with the ratings or review counts.
- Review count could show the user engagement but not the customer satisfaction or the performance of the business.

### Do restaurants with highest engagement tend to have high ratings?

- Result shows that there is a general increase in avergae review, check-in and tis counts as the ratings change from 1 to 4.
- Restaurants with 4 stars rated have the highest engagement, but the engagement decrease a liitle bit when the ratings raise to 5.

- The correlations show that the user engagement across different platforms is related, higher activity in one area tends to vbe associated with higher activity in the others.
- Businesses should focus on the strategies that increase all types of user engagement, as increases in one area will positively affect the others.
