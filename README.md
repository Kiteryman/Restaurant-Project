# Restaurant Success Analysis
## Problem Statement
This project aims to explore how user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) impacts business success metrics (review count, ratings) in the restaurant industry using the Yelp dataset.

## Research Objectives
1. Correlation Analysis: Determine if higher user engagement correlates with more reviews and higher ratings.
2. Sentiment Impact: Investigate how positive sentiment in reviews and tips affects review count and average star rating.
3. User Engagement Trends: Examine if consistent user engagement over time indicates long-term success better than sporadic activity.

## Hypotheses
- Higher user engagement leads to more reviews and better ratings.
- Positive sentiment in reviews and tips boosts overall ratings and review counts.
- Consistent engagement over time is linked to sustained restaurant success.
